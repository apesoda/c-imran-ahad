# C Practice
This repo is just a place where I store the exercises and practice taken from the book "Learn Programming with C" by Sazzad Imran and Atiqur Ahad. I'm by no means an expert but I do like to dabble in my downtime.

I'll occasionally update this whenever I get the time/remember to do so.

Includes other random C practice and ramblings
